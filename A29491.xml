            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READERS WHETHER Children or others.</head>
            <p>THis Youth was a very duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Child to his Parents, and patient, and ready to receive Inſtructions; never was known to reſiſt his Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Advice and Counſel, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to obey their Commands, and minded good things, being very baſhful, and ready to put himſelf forward to do any buſineſs to pleaſe his Parents or Relations; never <pb facs="tcp:31461:3"/>ſullen nor dogged; and what he did it was with all his might faithfully in Obedience to a meek and quiet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to the laſt minute. In the Time of his Health for Three Years last past, he uſed to go to hear at the Meetings of the People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> and no where elſe, and was by rude Boyes ſcoffed at, and called a <hi>Quaker.</hi> He was a very manly, meek and ſober Child, not given to quarrel with any. What we have here related, that he ſpoke of the great Love of the Lord, both to his own ſoul, and to his people, is far ſhort of what he declared. His Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hence was on the Third Day of the Fifth Moneth, <hi>1675.</hi> at 7 in the morning, the 13th Day of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; in great stilneſs and patience he en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>ON the 26th day of the fourth moneth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſeventh hour in the Evening being (as we thought) very near death, after he had layen ſilent for about an hour, he began to appear full of exceeding great joy &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, and his mouth was opened and he ſaid,</hi> I ſhall praiſe the Lord; for he is only to be praiſed: <hi>So he went on in Heavenly words in Prayer, to the admiration of the Nurſe &amp; Maid that heard him; of all which they only could rememeber that he ſaid in admiration.</hi>

            <p>Oh! I have never heard of any other God but thee, O my Holy One.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>And more and more he was changed, and filled with exceeding great Joy and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, and ſaid;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have heard of thee, but now I ſee thee in Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And many Heavenly ſayings and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions came from him; the Maid and Nurſe did think he had been near going away: He hearing them ſpeak ſo, He earneſtly ſaid,</hi> Pray call up my Father and Mother, for I have ſomething to ſay to them concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what I have ſeen of my Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So he went on uttering many Heavenly Sayings and Exhortations in ſound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; his Mother was called up, and ſeeing him ſo greatly changed in ſo ſhort a time, ſhe wept, and ran down ſtairs and called his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſeveral People that were there at that time, and when he heard them come up, he joyfully called out,</hi>

            <p>Father, Father, Oh Father; <hi>and held out his Hand, and ſhook his Father by the Hand, and ſaid.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>His Words were expreſſed in ſo great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power, that we were all amazed at them, being alſo in Meeter for the ſpace of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one hour and a half praiſing God, and admiring him, and his glorious Power, and Holy Order of glorified Saints and Holy Angels, and of the Glorious Day of God revealed, ſaid he. Some of which many Words he gave forth to us are as followeth, viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O moſt Glorious God, great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things are brought to paſs by thy own pure holy Power, by which thou haſt revealed thy Son unto us thy Miniſters, O my King, O let all People fear and ſtand in awe of thy Power, by which thou haſt gathered many out of their ſinful wayes, into pure Obedience to thee: Oh, thou haſt given us a living Knowledge of thee, O pu e, glorious, holy God, let thy Life reach unto all my dear Friends, and keep them that know thee firm and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt <pb n="4" facs="tcp:31461:6"/>upon thy Holy Foundation Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus my King, whoſe appearance is very glorious at this day, and of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment no end is to be; but Thouſands of Thouſands, Millions of Thouſands ſhall come to ſee, and be made with me, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his glorious bright ſhining-day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of which many Words more he ſpake which cannot be remembred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again he ſaid,</hi> O Glory, Glory, Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Praiſes be given to thee by me, and all we that know thee; O I have much to ſay for thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He was asked if he knew what he had ſaid? his anſwer was,</hi> I have preached the Goſpel to you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Father deſired all preſent to hearken and mind what he ſaid, and ſpake ſome of his words to them, but he was grieved, and ſaid:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O be ſilent all fleſh and ſtand by, for we that have ſeen thy pure mighty Glory can preach this Goſpel which is thy power, and the day comes on apace, that all that undertakes to ſpeak of thee, and obeyes not thy Power, by this Power they ſhall <pb n="5" facs="tcp:31461:6"/>be brought to Silence: There are many Ways and Baptiſms in the world; but Oh thou Pure, Holy, Holy one, we thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have known thy Spiritual Baptiſm into Chriſt Ieſus my Lord, by which the living water have we known and felt. Oh it is indeed exceeding pure, by which we have been waſhed from all our Sins. Oh my King thou waſt ſlain, and by the virtue of thy pure Blood, we have this gain. Oh that all may wait continually upon thee, that they may be kept from all the deceiveable wayes of this world. Oh mind and ſerve the Lord in your day; for his Holy Truth revealed in you is the Way in which you muſt Wait and Obey. Oh! Glorious are the Beams of the Sun that hath ſhined into my Heart, in which I have ſeen the Glory of his Day, although in the grave ſhortly this Body is to lie. But Oh Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Glory, and Halelujahs my Soul doth ſing to thee O my King, for the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Soul, that ſhall never dye; but in Praiſes pure for ever ſhall endure; a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taſte thou haſt given to me moſt ſure.

               </gap>ye, and gave a Sign to put it away, <hi>and ſaid,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh the Sons of God have better refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then a Cup of cold water. <hi>And ſo lay ſilent a while, but again ſpake as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</hi> The Lord hath taken me into his Kingdom, He hath diſcovered the freſh Springs of his Love to my Soul. O all that know the Lord, be obedient to his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and he will diſcover himſelf more to you, and you ſhall know more; Thouſands, Thouſands, Millons will the Lord call. O that my Kindred after the Fleſh might come to know the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again after ſome time of Silence he ſaid,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O that my Fellows, my Companions might know the Lord; they ſhall know the Lord, they ſhall follow me: Here be ſome ſtand by me that do not know the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which he repeated again, and again, and then ſaid,</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:31461:8"/>
            <p>What wait you to hear? What do you all ſtand here to hear?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Father anſwered him, they ſtand to hear what the Lord will ſpeak by thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſaid, No, all that are here do not wait to hear the Lord ſpeak; you do not all know the Lord, you think you know him; but you know him but in the Notion, but when you come to dye, you ſhall know, that you did not know the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When ſome ſpake of his being light headed, and as though he ſhould ſpeak he knew not what, he ſeemed grieved, and earneſtly ſaid,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had rather be torn alive by Dogs, then that an Impure or Unholy Word ſhould come out of my Mouth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some that knew him very well wondred to hear him ſpeak as he did, and ſaid, they had never heard ſuch words come from him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; he ſaid,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord hath fully made that known to my Soul, which I had ſome feeling of before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>On the next day about the Seventh Hour in the morning; he was very earneſt in Prayer ſoftly to himſelf; but ſome words were heard, viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:31461:8"/>
            <p>O let all that know not thy pure Truth come and receive it ſaith my Soul.</p>
            <p>And ſung of the Olive Tree, and the Ftuit thereof, which he had fed on, and of his Refreſhment he had thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He was asked what he meant by the Olive Tree? He ſaid,</hi> The Tree of Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And many more Heavenly Sayings he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered before he departed to his Everlaſting Reſt.</hi>
